## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using Python and PyTorch.
- Apply the GCN model to network data to perform tasks like node classification.
- Analyze the model's behavior, learning process, and performance metrics.
- Understand key architectural choices and their effects on the model's results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Analyzing_Network_GCN_Implementation_Group4.git
    cd Analyzing_Network_GCN_Implementation_Group4
